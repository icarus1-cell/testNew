    <p style="font-weight: 600;">
      Robert De Niro is widely celebrated as one of the most accomplished and versatile actors in the history of cinema. Born in New York City in 1943, De Niro grew up immersed in the rich cultural and artistic environment of Manhattan, which would go on to shape his lifelong dedication to the craft of acting. He studied at the Stella Adler Conservatory and later at Lee Strasberg’s Actors Studio, where he adopted method acting techniques that would come to define his intensely transformative performances. De Niro first gained attention for his work in the early 1970s, particularly through his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. His breakout role in Mean Streets (1973) was followed by a legendary performance in The Godfather Part II (1974), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro's ability to fully embody his characters was most famously showcased in Raging Bull (1980), where he underwent a dramatic physical transformation to portray boxer Jake LaMotta — a role that earned him the Oscar for Best Actor and solidified his reputation as a master of his craft.

Throughout his career, De Niro has consistently chosen roles that challenge and expand the boundaries of traditional acting. His filmography includes iconic performances in Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Goodfellas, Casino, and Heat, among others. Known for his quiet intensity, piercing gaze, and commitment to authenticity, De Niro often dives deep into the psychological and emotional complexities of his characters. Beyond his dramatic work, he has also shown a flair for comedy in films like Meet the Parents and The Intern, proving his range and longevity as a performer. In addition to acting, De Niro has made significant contributions to film as a producer and director, co-founding the Tribeca Film Festival to revitalize lower Manhattan after 9/11. His impact on American cinema is immeasurable, and his dedication to storytelling, both in front of and behind the camera, continues to inspire generations of artists around the world. <br> <br>
